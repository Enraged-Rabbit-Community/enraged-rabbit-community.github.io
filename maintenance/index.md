# Maintenance Guide

MMUs need maintenance!

### Periodic Checks

* Periodically check the ERCF hardware and make sure all components are properly attached and securely fastened. Check printed parts for stress signs (white discoloration) and cracks.
* Pay attention to the Selector. It should ride smoothly along the 8mm rods. If it doesn't, it may need tension or seating adjustment.
* Open the Selector hinge and check the gears for filament shavings and other debris. If you find an excessive amount the filament path may be obstructed.
* With the gear motor disabled and no filament loaded, the Drive Shaft and wheel should spin freely, easily, and without wobbling.
* Verify the proper seating of the PTFE tubes, they must be inserted all the way and must not rock in and out. If the tube backs out check the filament path and coupler.
* Check the hotend PTFE connection, make sure it does not wiggle and is securely fasted. If you are using a V6 make sure the block is properly attached to the heatbreak
* Other consumables like PTFE tubes need to be replaced on a 5000-10000h schedule. The PTFE tube will wear due to friction of the filament.
