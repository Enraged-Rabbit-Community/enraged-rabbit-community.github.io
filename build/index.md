# The Build

## Tools and Consumables Recommended:

-Ball-end Hex Drivers in 2.5 and 4mm sizes. 
-Straight-end Hex Driver in 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5mm sizes
-A bench vise or hand clamp to press-fit bearings
-Superglue for magnets
-Soldering iron for installing heatset inserts, and some light soldering if you're making your own LED wiring.
-Wiring crimper if you are making your own wiring harness

If you are a hard-core self-sourcer or upgrader, you may need to cut your own stock to length. In that case, you will want:
-A bench vise to hold your stock while cutting.
-Safety equipment like work gloves or welding gloves, a face shield or at least safety glasses, 
-A cutting tool capable of cutting hardened 5mm and 8mm steel rods. An angle grinder or other high-speed rotary tool.
-A chop saw, band saw, or other saw that can cut your aluminum 2020 extrusion at a right angle.
-An M5x0.5mm tap or tap set to tap the end of your 2020 extrusion. There are tools to help you tap your threads perfectly straight on the ERCF Github!

##Software recommended:
-A copy of the [Printed Parts Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h1bJurR6Z8Ou36c5U9cWmqI86tXKlWrcZrWrHgGN13A)
-A PDF reader to read your copy of the [Build Manual PDF](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/blob/master/Documentation/ERCF_v2_Manual.pdf)
-CAD software to look at your copy of the [ERCF CAD file](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/tree/master/CAD) while building.
Hundreds of hours of work went into making both the Build Manual and CAD so that at any point in the build, you can sync the CAD file with the Build Manual.
