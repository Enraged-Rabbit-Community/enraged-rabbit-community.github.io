# Community Documentation

This is a repository of the tremendous amount of knowledge that has been put together by ERCF owners.

- The [Printed Parts Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h1bJurR6Z8Ou36c5U9cWmqI86tXKlWrcZrWrHgGN13A) by Miriax
- The [Build Manual PDF](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/blob/master/Documentation/ERCF_v2_Manual.pdf) is also by Miriax with contributions and inspiration from the Voron and ERCF dev teams.
- The [ERCF CAD file](https://github.com/Enraged-Rabbit-Community/ERCF_v2/tree/master/CAD) is a combination of community contributions from moggieuk, sneakytreesnake, gneu42, mnneuhaus, kinematicdigit, Miriax, and IRTrail.

Almost anything you want to know about the software side of ERCF is documented on the (Happy Hare Wiki)[https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare/wiki]. Happy Hare is made by moggieuk, and the documentation is mainly done by moggieuk, ningpj, and IRTrail.
