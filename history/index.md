# ERCF History

ERCF started with Ette's version 1 in 2021.

Sneakytreesnake, looking to improve the sturdiness of v1, created SturdyBunny, which uses 2020 instead of threaded rod.

Gneu wanted better Filament Blocks, so he made them.

Mneuhaus wanted a functional encoder, so he created Binky and the Encoder housing for it.

moggieuk coordinated these efforts into ERCF Community Edition in mid 2023. 

moggieuk also created Happy Hare software to interface ERCF with Klipper in mid 2023.

The project continues to evolve to improve documentation and innovate new parts to improve the functionality of ERCF, and here we are!
